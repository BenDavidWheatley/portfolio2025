        In 2021 I came on board to rebuild their website, and I have been managing and improving it ever since.

        ts cutting-edge technology. Key features include sections for software products, hardware offerings 
        (such as cameras and markers), applications (like sports performance and VR training), 
        case studies as well as support, sales and demo enquiry forms that integrate with the companyâ€™s CRM system (sales).
        We're in the early stages now of building an online shop to sell spare parts.`,
